# The Hierarchy Store #

The cbtree Hierarchy Store is devired from the cbtree [Memory and Natural](Store)
Store. The Hierarchy Store is capable of, as the name implies, maintaining the hierarchy
and natural order amongst store objects. To do this the store adds a so-called parent
property to each object in the store and optionally maintains an index of all children of
store objects.

The hierarchy store and the derived Object Store are the preferred store types in a CheckBox
Tree environment.
