The CheckBox Tree comes with three store models, that is, a [Tree Store Model](#tree-store-model),
a [Forest Store Model](#forest-store-model) and a [File Store Model](#file-store-model).
The distinct differences are explained in the sections below. Which store
model to use primarily depends on:

1. How the data store is structured.
2. How you are going to query the store.
