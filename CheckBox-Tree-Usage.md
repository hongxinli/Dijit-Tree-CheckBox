<h2 id="working-with-events">Working with Events</h2>

With dojo 1.7 a new event handling module was introduced called `dojo/on`. 
The intend of this module is/was to make event handling with dojo easier and 
mimic some of the DOM4 Event system. However, `dojo/on` is far from a self 
contained DOM-4 Event system implementation.  
In addition, dijit widgets inherit a modified version of `dojo/on` to make it
backward compatible with callback methods and non-DOM compliant events.
The `dijit/_WidgetBase.on()` method tries to map event types, case insensitive
that is, to callback functions whose name starts with "on" like *onClick()* or 
*onDblClick()*.

The next sections discuss the difference in implementation of event listeners
for callbacks and events.

<h3><span class="mega-icon mega-icon-arr-collapsed"></span>Callbacks</h3>

Before we establish an event listener with a dijit widget we must fist check if
the widget has a method that could be auto linked with the event type. 
For example, if we want to listen for an event named "myEvent", does the widget
have a method called `onMyEvent()` or `onmyevent()`?  
If so, we need to define our event listener as a callback function with the
same set of argument as the widget's onMyEvent() method.

Let's assume our widget has a method (callback) called `onMyEvent()` with a
signature like: `onMyEvent( item, node, event )` in which case we can establish
our event listener in two ways:

1. Using `dojo/aspect` or,
2. Call the widget's `on()` method.

##### Using dojo/aspect.
Using `dojo/aspect` we attach **_after_** advice to the widget method so our event
listener gets called each time the widget calls `onMyEvent()` like:

```javascript
require(["dojo/aspect", "cbtree/Tree", ... ], function (aspect, Tree, ... ) {
    // Event listener
    function clickEvent( item, node, event ) {
      console.log( "A Tree Node was clicked" );
    }
                   ...
    var myTree  = new Tree( {model:someModel, ... } );
    aspect.after( myTree, "onMyEvent", clickEvent, true );
                   ...
})
```
<span class="mega-icon mega-icon-exclamation"></span> Make sure the fourth
argument is set to **_true_** otherwise `clickEvent()` is not called with the
original arguments of `onMyEvent()` but with the result instead. Also, notice
that when calling `aspect.after()` we specify the callback function name 
"onMyEvent" and not an event type.



##### Using widget on() method.
Using the widget's `on()` method we specify the event type "myEvent" and not the
callback function name, like:

```javascript
require(["cbtree/Tree", ... ], function (Tree, ... ) {
    // Event listener
    function clickEvent( item, node, event ) {
      console.log( "A Tree Node was clicked" );
    }
                   ...
    var myTree  = new Tree( {model:someModel, ... } );
    myTree.on( "myEvent", clickEvent );
                   ...
})
```
The above example accomplishes exactly the same thing as dojo/aspect did in the
first example simply because the underlaying `_WidgetBase.on()` method is able
to map the event type "myEvent" to the callback `onMyEvent()` and as a result
calls dojo/aspect on our behalf.

<h3><span class="mega-icon mega-icon-arr-collapsed"></span>Events</h3>

This time, let's assume our widget does **_NOT_** have a callback that could be
auto linked to the event type "myEvent". Instead the widget actually emits events 
of type "myEvent". In this case both dojo/aspect and the widget's on() method
will automatically create the callback, which in our case will be named "onmyEvent".

The big difference between the widget calling callback functions programmatically
and emitting events is the way the event listener will be called. In the latter 
case the event handlers are called with just one argument, the event.

```javascript
require(["cbtree/Tree", ... ], function (Tree, ... ) {
    // Event listener
    function clickEvent( event ) {
      console.log( "A Tree Node was clicked" );
    }
                   ...
    var myTree  = new Tree( {model:someModel, ... } );
    myTree.on( "myEvent", clickEvent );
                   ...
})
```
In the above example notice that the function `clickEvent()` now is called with
just a single argument **_event_**. The event is a JavaScript key:value pairs
object.

<span class="mega-icon mega-icon-exclamation"></span> In case of true events 
that is, the event name can not be mapped to a callback function, the event name 
is handled case sensitive. Therefore, as a good practise, always use the correct
case for event names regardless if you are registering for an event or callback.
Note that DOM-3/4 always handles event types case sensitive.

<h2 id="callbacks-and-events">Callbacks and Events</h2>

The CheckBox Tree modules use both callbacks and events. Callbacks are used 
whenever dojo or dijit API's require them, for example the dijit model API 
`dijit/tree/model`, otherwise events are used.

The tables below list the event names and associated callback by CheckBox Tree
module. If for any given event type a callback is specified, the arguments
column specifies the list of arguments passed to the event listener.

The arguments passed to event handles are defined as follows:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Argument</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>event</td>
		<td>Event object, the object is context specific</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>item</td>
		<td>Store object</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>node</td>
		<td>Tree node widget</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Tree Events
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Event Type</th>
		<th>Callback</th>
		<th>Arguments</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>click</td>
    <td>onClick</td>
    <td>(item, node, event)</td>
		<td>
			A tree node is clicked.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>checkBoxClick</td>
    <td>onCheckBoxClick</td>
    <td>(item, node, event)</td>
		<td>
			A checkbox is clicked.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>close</td>
    <td>onClose</td>
    <td>(item, node)</td>
		<td>
			Node closed, a tree node collapsed.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>dblClick</td>
    <td>onDblClick</td>
    <td>(item, node, event)</td>
		<td>
			Double click
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>open</td>
    <td>onOpen</td>
    <td>(item, node)</td>
		<td>
			Node opened. a tree node is expanded.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>event</td>
    <td>onEvent</td>
    <td>(item, event, value)</td>
		<td>
			User event successful.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>load</td>
    <td>onLoad</td>
    <td>(void)</td>
		<td>
			Tree finished loading.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>




### Model Events
The CheckBox Tree models, although not widgets, offer the same `on()`
functionality as widgets do. Therefore you can simple register a model event
listener like `model.on( "dataValidated", myEventHandler );`

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Event Type</th>
		<th>Callback</th>
		<th>Arguments</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>change</td>
    <td>onChange</td>
    <td>(item, propertyName, newValue, oldValue)</td>
		<td>
			Property of a store item changed.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>childrenChange</td>
    <td>onChildrenChange</td>
    <td>(parent, newChildrenList)</td>
		<td>
			The children of a node changed.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>delete</td>
    <td>onDelete</td>
    <td>(item)</td>
		<td>
			Store item removed
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>rootChange</td>
    <td>onRootChange</td>
    <td>(item, action)</td>
		<td>
			The children of the tree root changed.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>dataValidated</td>
    <td>onDataValidated</td>
    <td>(void)</td>
		<td>
			The store data has been validated.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Store Events

<span class="mega-icon mega-icon-exclamation"></span> Store events are available
if, and only if, the store is made [Eventable](Store#wiki-eventable) or the 
store is a [cbtree/store/Object](Store#wiki-the-object-store) store.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Event Type</th>
		<th>Callback</th>
		<th>Argument</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>change</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>(event)</td>
		<td>
			Property of a store object changed.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>new</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>(event)</td>
		<td>
			A new store object was added.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>remove</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>(event)</td>
		<td>
			A store object was removed/deleted.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### An example
The following example demonstrate the use of events and callbacks:

```javascript
require( ["cbtree/Tree",
          "cbtree/model/ForestStoreModel",
          "cbtree/store/Memory",
          "cbtree/store/Eventable"], function (Tree, ForestStoreModel, Memory, Eventable) {
                    ...
  // Create an eventable store and listen for events of type "new".
  var myStore = Eventable( new Memory( {data: myData, idProperty:"name"} ));
  myStore.on( "new", function (event) {
    console.log( "An event of type: " + event.type + "was recieved" );
    console.log( "Object with id: " + this.getIdentity( event.item ) + " was added");
  });

  var myModel = new ForestStoreModel( {store:myStore, query:{type:"parent"}} );
  myModel.on( "dataValidated", function () {
    console.log( "Store data has been validated" );
  });

  var myTree  = new Tree( {model:myModel}, "CheckboxTree" };
  myTree.on( "load", function () {
    console.log( "The Tree has been loaded." );
  }
  myTree.startup();
                    ...
  myStore.put( {name:"Lisa", lastName:"Simpson", hair:"blond"} );
}
```
